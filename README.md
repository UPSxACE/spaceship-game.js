# Spaceship Game Js
## Introduction
After finishing the first module of the Ironhack bootcamp, we are requested to make a small javascript game to apply our knowledge in the language, HTML Dom, and OOP. I chose to make a game using Canvas API.
## Concept
The game takes place in the outer space, and it's supposed to feel like a retro arcade game. 
The player controls a spaceship to dodge and shoot asteroids that randomly appear in the screen. 
Each level it gets harder, because those asteroids spawn more frequently and move even faster too.
## Controls
- `Arrows` -> Control the spaceship
- `space` -> Shoot
## Setup
You can play the game in my github page, but if you'd like to run it locally in your browser:

-  `git clone https://github.com/UPSxACE/spaceship-game.js` in your terminal
-  `cd space-game.js`
-  open index.html
